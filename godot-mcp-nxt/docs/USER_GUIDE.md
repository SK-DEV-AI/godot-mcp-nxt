## Getting Started - Enterprise Edition

### 🚀 **4-Phase Setup Process**

#### **Phase 1: Prerequisites & Installation**
```bash
# 1. Verify system requirements
node --version  # Should be 18+
npm --version   # Should be 8+
godot --version # Should be 4.4+

# 2. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/SK-DEV-AI/godot-mcp-nxt.git
cd godot-mcp-nxt
npm install

# 3. Build enterprise server
npm run build

# 4. Install Godot addon
cp -r addons/godot_mcp /path/to/your/godot/project/addons/
# Enable in Godot: Project → Project Settings → Plugins → Godot MCP
```

#### **Phase 2: Enterprise Configuration**
```bash
# 🎯 FULLY AUTOMATED - No Manual Server Management Required!

# Option 1: Configure via Godot Editor UI (Recommended)
# Open Godot → Bottom Panel → MCP Server → Settings Tab
# Configure all options visually:
# • Port: 9080 (MCP_PORT)
# • Auto-start: Enable/Disable
# • Debug Mode: Enable/Disable (MCP_DEBUG)
# • Rate Limit: 100 requests/sec (MCP_RATE_LIMIT)
# • Audit Logging: Enable/Disable (MCP_AUDIT_LOG)
# Click "Save Configuration"
#
# Server starts/stops automatically based on your settings!

# Option 2: Legacy environment variables (still supported)
export MCP_PORT=9080
export MCP_DEBUG=true
export MCP_RATE_LIMIT=100
export MCP_AUDIT_LOG=true

# Start enterprise server (automated in production)
npm start
```

### **🤖 Fully Automated Server Management**
**Users have ZERO server management responsibilities!**

- ✅ **Auto-Start**: Server starts automatically when Godot opens (if enabled)
- ✅ **Auto-Stop**: Server stops automatically when Godot closes
- ✅ **Auto-Recovery**: Handles connection issues and port conflicts
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
- ✅ **Background Operation**: Runs silently in the background

**What users DO need to do:**
1. Open Godot Editor
2. Configure settings in UI (optional)
3. Use AI tools - everything else is automatic!
